Hello world and welcome to my blog! I’m very excited to start this blog and share my passion in NLP with anyone who wants to read it. My goal with the blog is to create interesting and informative posts about subjects in NLP and Machine Learning both in industry and research/academia, so I hope you are able to get something useful from them! In addition, I’ll also try to make posts about other topics I’m interested in like history, classical music, or general linguistics. I think it’s very important to balance IT and CS study with a healthy dose of humanities and social science knowledge, so I hope you’ll find those posts exciting and enlightening as well.

For the time being, I’m not planning a regular schedule for posts, so whenever I have a post I’ll send out a tweet about it (you can follow me @NickWalkerAZ). Also, as a fun addition to my posts, I’ll include a link to a particular piece of music that is on my mind at the time of the post, just as a little extra to the content! So for my inaugural post, I present to you the beautiful finale to Mozart’s String Quintet in B-Flat Major:
