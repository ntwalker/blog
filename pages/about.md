My name is Nick Walker, and I'm an NLP Engineer based in Atlanta, GA. I got my MS in Human Language Technology at the University of Arizona in Tucson, and I continue to study NLP topics as a part of my job as well as for my own enjoyment. This blog is meant to be a resource on NLP topics, as well as a source of fun information on other topics like history and classical music (when I can find good topics to write about).

(For the time being this blog is under construction, so stay tuned for it to be ready for presentation!)
